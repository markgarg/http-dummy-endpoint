# http-dummy-endpoint
Ever had to push to a dummy HTTP endpoint to see your request data ?
I found tools like requestb.in need to have a bin created to direct requests to them. If you are using an API, then there's no programmatic
access to create a bin. This app is a temporary store for such requirements.
